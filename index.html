          <p>
            Rushmore is a 1998 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film directed
            by Wes Anderson about an eccentric teenager named Max Fischer (Jason
            Schwartzman in his film debut), his friendship with rich
            industrialist Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and their love in common
            for elementary school teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). The
            film was co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson. The soundtrack
            features several songs by bands associated with the British Invasion
            of the 1960s. Filming began in November 1997 around Houston, Texas,
            and lasted 50 days, until late January 1998.

            The Royal Tenenbaums is a 2001 American comedy-drama film directed
            by Wes Anderson and co-written with Owen Wilson. It stars Danny
            Glover, Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Bill Murray, Gwyneth Paltrow,
            Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Owen Wilson. Ostensibly based on a
            nonexistent novel, and told with a narrative influenced by the
            writing of J. D. Salinger, it follows the lives of three gifted
            siblings who experience great success in youth, and even greater
            disappointment and failure in adulthood. The children's eccentric
            father Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) leaves them in their adolescent
            years, then returns to them after they have grown, falsely claiming
            he has a terminal illness. He works on reconciling with his children
            and ex-wife (Huston).

            The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama film written and
            directed by Wes Anderson. Ralph Fiennes leads a seventeen-actor
            ensemble cast as Monsieur Gustave H., famed concierge of a
            twentieth-century mountainside resort in the fictional Eastern

            of a wealthy dowager (Tilda Swinton), he and his recently befriended
            protégé Zero (Tony Revolori) embark on a quest for fortune and a

            Searchlight supervised the commercial distribution, and The Grand
            Budapest Hotel's funding was sourced through Indian Paintbrush and
            German government-funded tax rebates.
